'Years after the return of the Avatar and the war had ended a new nation emerged, a nation of blood. Powered by dark spirits and fueled by rage and revenge for their people, a group of blood benders formed Blood Nation.

The blood benders made a deal with the dark spirits, allowing the spirits to inhabit their bodies in exchange for enhancing their blood bending capabilities beyond imagination. The dark spirits bestowed the ability to control anyone from anywhere as long as they have been infected with dark spirit energy.

They have declared war on the Fire Nation and have begun to advance their brainwashed armies. Coming into contact with anyone infected with the dark spirit energy results in the infection immediatelly spreading and taking control of their mind, joining the Blood Nation.
