'[SUBJECT]: Rock Slides in the Kolau Mountains

Defenders of the Fire Nation,

We have received reports of an unusual number of large rock slides in the Kolau Mountains in the Earth Kingdom. This could be related to Blood Nation activity. We’re sending you in to investigate and determine if there is any threat.

While you’re in the Earth Kingdom we’d like you to recruit Toph Beifong to aid in our efforts against the Blood Nation. She may be stubborn about it, so you will have to prove you’re worthy of her help… I wish you good luck.

- General Zuko
