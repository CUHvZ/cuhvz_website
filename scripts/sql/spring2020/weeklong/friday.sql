'[SUBJECT]: Invasion

Defenders of the Fire Nation,

We have failed: the invasion has begun. All citizens that are not infected by the Dark Spirits must be evacuated immediately. We will send in an airship at 5 pm to pick up all survivors that have registered themselves in the logbook.

Our last hope is the Avatar. Avatar Aang will travel to the Spirit world to talk to Koh in hopes of learning of a way to stop the Dark Spirits. Aang must be protected while in the Avatar state. If he falls under the control of the Blood Nationâ€¦ all hope will be lost.
