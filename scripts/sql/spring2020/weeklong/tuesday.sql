'[SUBJECT]: Defend the Moon Spirit

Defenders of the Fire Nation,

In the aftermath of yesterdayâ€™s events, it has come to our attention that the citizens of the Northern Water tribe have been disappearing. We believe that the Blood Nation is behind these disappearances and that they plan to steal the Moon spirit to further increase their blood bending abilities. Go and protect the Moon spirit at all costs.

I have sent out supplies to any of those who may need it but beware that Blood Nation soldiers may try to steal them.

- General Zuko
