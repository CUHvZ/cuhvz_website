'[SUBJECT]: Investigate the Rig

Defenders of the Fire Nation,

We’ve received reports of Blood Nation forces inhabiting the abandoned Fire Nation prison rig. We need volunteers to go investigate if the rumors are true. Be careful, as the rig is old, unstable and has begun to collapse. Remove any Blood Nation forces that reside there and return home safely.

Remember, don’t come into contact with any of the Blood Nation forces. We must stop the dark spirits from spreading.

- General Zuko
