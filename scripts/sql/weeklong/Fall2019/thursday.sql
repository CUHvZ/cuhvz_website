Hello? Hello, this is Commissioner Gordon.
The Joker is up to his schemes and we need to stop him. His towers have been set up at 3 locations on CU Boulder's campus. These towers go off every 30 minutes and must be deactivated to prevent them from releasing more of Poison Ivy's gas into the atmosphere. Shutting down these towers won't be enough to stop them alone, the zombies can reactivate the towers so you must make sure to keep deactivating them. LINK_NEW_TAB[Here are the locations of the towers.][/images/control_tower_map.png]

The joker has also hinted at causing more mayhem at Scott Carpenter at 5pm. Please come and help stop his evil plans.

We need your help heroes.
Commissioner Gordon
