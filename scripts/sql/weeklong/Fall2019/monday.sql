'[SUBJECT]: Villainy is Afoot
Attention League of Heroes,

This is Commissioner Gordon from the Gotham City Police Department.

We recently had an alarming report reach the Gotham Police. Poison Ivy and a band of villains have been planning something dastardly; thereâ€™s been increased activity targeting chemical transports and chemical storage centers. We think they may be planning to create some sort of poison. Those affected by the poison have turned into zombie-like slaves.

I will be dispatched to Boulder, Colorado to attempt to track down these villains before they can complete their plan.

We need you to come and agree to help us track down these fiends. Today at the BOLD[UMC is the final day to receive bandanas and turn in your waiver]. We will have a table set up for you to do so. There will be BOLD[no off campus mission] today on account of weather.

Stay Vigilant,
Commissioner Gordon
