'[SUBJECT]: The Riddler
Attention Heroes,

This is Commissioner Gordon.

I have danINCLUDE[riddler.txt]

Hello, hello, hello, mindless people of Boulder.

I have a dangerous game to play, for those of you who are able. My games and riddles will bring you down to the cable.

I have many gifts set, now it\'s time for you to fret. Three by three you must find for me, carefully placed will be the key. Central Park you must go, or let the zombie horde grow.

Follow my riddles, disable my tricks, and you may live to see another day.

So what do you say,
Want to play?

- The Riddler

I have one more riddle for you friends,
We are what is necessary for your life
But if you eat us you may be dead
Pick a number, a supply for you
Beware whether it’s aid is false or true.
Poison can be deadly.

Heroes, this is commissioner Gordon. I do not know what the Riddler is planning but we know he will be active at Central park at 5pm. Please aid me in capturing him and foiling his plans.

Stay Vigilant,
Commissioner Gordon
