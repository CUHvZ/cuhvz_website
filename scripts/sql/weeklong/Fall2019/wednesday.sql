[SUBJECT] Winter is Coming and Frost is Leading It
Attention Heroes,

This is Commissioner Gordon. I must first inform you that yesterday's mission failed. The Riddler was able to denote his packages releasing more of Poison Ivy's gas, this has resulted in these 'zombies' becoming more powerful.

---- Zombie stun timer has been reduced to 4 minutes ----

We’ve recently had reports of Killer Frost being active in the Boulder area. She is dangerous, and anyone who has tried to stop her has been frozen and reanimated as one of Ivy’s Zombies. She has been attempting to speed up the process of winter to make people more susceptible to the toxin Poison Ivy is making.
We have a plan on how to stop her: Frost is extremely self-conscious about her appearance and jealousy can be a way to drive her into the open. We need you to take 'selfies' at specific locations showing off yourself and your friends. This should demoralize Frost and make her easier to capture. See image below for locations where the selfies must be taken, we're not sure where these are but we do know that these locations are the ones that will bring Killer Frost out in the open. At least 30 total correct selfies must be achieved to draw her out.

I've also sent out more supplies to those who need it but this batch seems to attract the zombies and they are eating it. Get to those supply drops fast before the zombies steal them all
We have also received information about a robbery that is going to occur at Martin park at 5 pm. Meet there to intercept the thieves.

Best of luck Heroes,
Gordon
