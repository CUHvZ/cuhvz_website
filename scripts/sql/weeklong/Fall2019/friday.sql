Attention Heroes,

Yesterdays missions proved to be failures and the zombies are reaching staggeringly dangerous levels.

****** Zombie stun timer is now 1 minute ******

The city is in grave parrel. Lex Luthor plans to launch an attack on the city. We must evacuate all remaining heroes and citizens that have not yet been infected. I have set up a log that you can write your name in so we know who to evacuate and we will send a chopper to get you at Beach park at 5pm today. LINK_NEW_TAB[Here is the location of the log][https://www.google.com/maps/@40.0079274,-105.2711151,3a,75y,35.01h,74.28t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sf2hKqkG6UyTgThoKv6XnOQ!2e0!7i13312!8i6656].

I have also sent out the last of our supplies for those in need.

Good luck heroes,
Commissioner Gordan
