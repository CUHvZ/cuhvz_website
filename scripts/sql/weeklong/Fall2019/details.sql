'Boulder is in chaos. Poison Ivy has created a super-virus that’s turning people into her zombie slaves. But she’s not alone. She’s teamed up with villains from all over the multiverse so that they’re powerful enough to take over the city. We need your help to stop them.

Details/Rules:
- Off-campus is not perma death for humans, just for fun and points. Humans that ger tagged during off-campus missions will remain human after the mission and zombies will still get their points.
- Yellow bandana must be worn around your leg to identify you as a player of the game.
- The green bandana is worn on your head for zombies and around arm for humans.
- Poisoned supply drops will reduce effectiveness of the next 3 supply drops used. After 3 unpoisoned supply drops have been collected the poison is cured.
