Per tradition, the off-campus mission takes place at Chautauqua park. Before starting the game, any remaining Deely Boppers are distributed to the surviving humans. During the mission, if a zombie kills a human who is carrying deely-boppers, then the zombie gets those boppers and becomes a Special Infected. In order to win, humans must defend the gazebo from the zombies for the full 45 minutes. Zombies win by having SPECIAL INFECTED touching both main pillars of the gazebo simultaneously for a eight-count, or by killing all the humans. In this way, the humans must defend the gazebo from the Special Infected for the entire duration of the game. Note that if the zombies win the on-campus mission that day, then the Special Infected will have a stun timer of only 1 minute.

So, the humans and zombies arrive at the park. At 5:00, the zombies begin attacking the gazebo. If, at any point, at least two Special Infected enter the gazebo and are simultaneously touching the pillars for a full eight-count, then the humans lose and the weeklong ends.
