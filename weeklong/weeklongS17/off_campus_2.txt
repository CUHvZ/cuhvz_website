The second off-campus mission will be at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/9L62BGE9eFB2">Beach park</a>, and will feature two deely boppers, placed on opposite ends (northeast and southwest) of the small square park. As before, the humans are attempting to protect both deely boppers for the entire hour between 5:00 and 5:45. If one of the deely-boppers is taken during the mission, the zombie who took it has his spawn time lowered to 30 seconds.
<br><br>
If the humans are able to defend both points â€“ The zombie stun timer is raised by one minute, and 10 vaccines will be distributed among the surviving human (maximum one per player.)
For each bopper the zombies are able to recover, the zombie stun timer is lowered by one minute for the next day.
