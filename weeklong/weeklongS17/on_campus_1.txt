Between 10:00 and 4:00, humans must <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/T3qu61iSeds">go here</a>, to the stone monument in the center of the little park,
and sign their name to the list. By the time 4:00 rolls around, if 2/3 of the human population has not signed their name to the list, the zombies win. If there are enough signatures, then the humans win and receive the location of the first off-campus mission.
If the humans win – they will receive a hint to the code which gives them the location of the off-campus mission
If the zombies win – they will get that hint
(This mission has essentially two purposes: It is easy, and can be accomplished by individuals without too much effort and in accordance with their schedule, while also giving them opportunities to see and interact with each other. It also reinforces the idea that humans are united in their goals.  At the same time, it also gives the OZs a much higher chance of finding humans to kill on that first day, since there will be high traffic through that one area. The humans will likely win the mission, but many of them will be tagged nonetheless.)
