Greetings Warriors,

Yesterday's mission at Scott Carpenter park proved to be a failure, resulting in the zombie stun timer to be reduced to 4 minutes.

My son Loki is hiding himself in the form a fish. We must obtain pieces of a net that have been scattered throughout campus. To obtain these pieces you must locate these statues and take “selfies” and submit them on discord using the instructions provided below. These "selfies" will capture the pieces of the net in the picture. All four locations must be captured for the piece of the net to be obtained. Warriors must work together to collect a total of 10 pieces in order to build the net.

Please locate these statues and take a "selfie":

Once the net pieces have been collected we can construct the net at Central Park and capture Loki at 6 PM. We must hold the area until the net can be constructed and then we may catch my son.

My children, I understand that you are needing sustenance to continue forth, I have sent you food for you and your families. The supplies have been sent to the following locations with the given amount of supplies at each location:

Sign #2: 25 supplies
Sign #6: 25 supplies
Sign #11: 25 supplies
Sign #18: 25 supplies
By aware the humans may only take one supply drop from any given location but they are allowed to collect from as many locations as they wish. Supply drops will increase the human stun timer by 24 hours with a cap for 48 hours. Collecting a supply drop also rewards that player with 10 points. Zombies cannot collect supply drops but are allowed to stalk those locations.

Farewell my children,

The All Father
