This weeklong will be different than past weeklongs. This time we have Nerf blasters for the top 3 players! The players with the most points at the end of the weeklong will get to choose their prize blaster as well as securing a ticket to the lockin event that Friday night. Players can earn points by participating in off-campus missions, collecting supply drops and getting kills.

1st place: Hyperfire or Hades
2nd place: Surgefire or Hera
3rd place: Strongarm or Kronos

Zombie stun timer will start at 5 minutes but can be reduced if humans fail their daily missions.

We've also changed up how are humans have to play. Now humans have a starve timer and inactive humans will die if they don't go out and collect supply drops.
Here are all the sign locations for potential supply drops. Humans must enter the 5 character code, located on the bottom of the signs, in order to receive the supply drop. Keep in mind that there will be a limited number of supply drops at each location so make sure you get there before other humans! You can also receive supply drops by going to off-campus missions.

The skies weep
o’er fire and ice
the gods
now risen
the earth
now fallen

Great Odin
the gates of
Valhalla
he shall open
and come forth
warriors of light

On this day,
brave warriors,
while thine
might now stand
who among you
will fall?

Ragnarok
is upon you
and with it comes
the final stone is turned
as humanity falls
to chaos,

Come now warriors
will you die
like trampled flowers
or will you stand
and make the darkness
fear your cry?


Chaos is here, friends, as it has been foretold. The army of the dead have risen to their God’s command, and we must stand to face them. The gods are at out back, out weapons blessed by their hands, we must fight so that they might survive so that we might live to see the light of the sun once more. Surtr is coming, we are the last hope. If he triumphs, all will burn in his rage.
Will you answer the call?
