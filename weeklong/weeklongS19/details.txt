The skies weep
o’er fire and ice
the gods
now risen
the earth
now fallen

Great Odin
the gates of
Valhalla
he shall open
and come forth
warriors of light

On this day,
brave warriors,
while thine
might now stand
who among you
will fall?

Ragnarok
is upon you
and with it comes
the final stone is turned
as humanity falls
to chaos,

Come now warriors
will you die
like trampled flowers
or will you stand
and make the darkness
fear your cry?


Chaos is here, friends, as it has been foretold. The army of the dead have risen to their God’s command, and we must stand to face them. The gods are at out back, out weapons blessed by their hands, we must fight so that they might survive so that we might live to see the light of the sun once more. Surtr is coming, we are the last hope. If he triumphs, all will burn in his rage.
Will you answer the call?
