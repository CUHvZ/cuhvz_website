Greetings Warriors,

Yesterday humans took heavy losses and were unable to hold their stations and failed at saving their family members. The zombie stun timer has reached its lowest at 1 minute. I wish you good luck to those who are left standing, you are our last hope.

Today my message to you is one of grief. Ragnarok is upon us. The giants are overtaking the realms and now the gods must step in to protect the last survivors. Today my children, you must write your name on a scroll to ensure the protection of the gods. We will preserve you, warriors, to ensure the greatest success in the battle for peace but you must still be human at the end of the day to receive that protection. On campus mission is to write your name an a book in the area with the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@40.0079274,-105.2711151,3a,75y,35.01h,74.28t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sf2hKqkG6UyTgThoKv6XnOQ!2e0!7i13312!8i6656" target="_blank" >Rock with a square cut out of it.</a>

Come now brave warriors, the time for battle is near. The Lock in is Tonight, doors open at 9pm and close at 10pm.

The All Father
