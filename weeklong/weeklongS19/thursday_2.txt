Greetings Warriors,

Yesterday proved to be disastrous as humans lost both the on and off campus missions resulting in the zombie stun timer being 1 minute and 30 seconds.

Loki has broken free from his chains and the Earth has started to rumble. Buildings are crumbling and are being overrun by Hel's undead army. You must hold your outposts or there will be dire consequences.On campus is tower defense, poles with bandannas tied to them are defenses, humans must hold the towers by putting the bandanna above the line. Zombies must hold the tower by putting the bandanna below the line. Points will be recorded every half hour and posted on Discord. Refer to this map for locations of the control towers.

The last of the supplies have been sent out but Loki has taken it upon himself to hide one of the supply drops and all I can see is that it's located somewhere within the marked area. Here are the supply drops to collect.
Sign #12: 10 uses, +24 hours, +20 points
Sign #3: 10 uses, +24 hours, +20 points
Stolen supply drop: 10 uses, +24 hours, + 40 points

Tonight we must preserve what we can and protect our ancient bloodlines. Warriors must rendezvous at Martin Park to help escort friends and families to safety. The undead will be upon us so come prepared. Off campus is escort at Martin Park at 6 PM.

 
The day is growing dark my children.
Farewell,
The All Father
