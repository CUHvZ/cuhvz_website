Zombies must join hands in a giant circle around the patch of grass in the biking roundabout in front of the EC. If they surround the entire circle with unstunned zombies, they win, and get deely boppers for Chautauqua. If they cannot succeed at this within 45 minutes, humans win a shortened time for Chautauqua. Zombies may not enter the circle itself, but humans may.
