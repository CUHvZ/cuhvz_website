[SUBJECT] EYES ONLY not hands or teeth

All forces near checkpoint Omega should converge to Beach park. Hostile agents are attracted to unidentified noodle shaped objects which have been detected near a playground and should be handled with extreme care. Civilians have been told that we will be performing fumigation in the area. Get your stories straight. Any unauthorized personnel should be diverted. Secure the objects from any and all hostiles and wait for item extraction.
